# Hackerrank
HackerRank Solutions
This repository contains my solutions to various HackerRank problems in C and Python. The solutions are organized into separate folders for each language.

# C Solutions
The c-solutions folder contains my solutions to HackerRank problems written in C. Each problem is in its own folder, with a descriptive name that matches the problem title on HackerRank.

To compile and run the C solutions, use a C compiler such as GCC. For example, to compile and run the solution to the hello-world problem, navigate to the c-solutions/hello-world folder and run the following commands:

```c
gcc -o hello-world hello-world.c
./hello-world
```

# Python Solutions
The python-solutions folder contains my solutions to HackerRank problems written in Python. Each problem is in its own folder, with a descriptive name that matches the problem title on HackerRank.

To run the Python solutions, make sure you have Python installed on your system. For example, to run the solution to the hello-world problem, navigate to the python-solutions/hello-world folder and run the following command:

```python
python hello-world.py
```
# Java Solutions
The java-solutions folder contains my solutions to HackerRank problems written in Java. Each problem has its own file with the problem name as the file name.

To compile and run the Java solutions, make sure you have Java installed on your system. For example, to compile and run the solution to the hello-world problem, navigate to the java-solutions folder and run the following commands:

```java
javac HelloWorld.java
java HelloWorld
```
